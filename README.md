Note Taker is a program that allows one to add, edit or delete notes.

The user is initially presented to the main homepage for Note Taker and there is a "Get Started" button that will redirect the user to another website where notes can be created, deleted or edited

This was created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript and Express.js framework.

Javascript was used to add the functional logic of allowing users to add/edit/delete notes.

Express.js framework is implemented to connect the frontend to backend framework, create a GET, POST, and DELETE requests to either retrieve all notes from the database, send note data to the database, or to delete a specific note based off it's id, and also used to deploy the full stack website through Heroku.
